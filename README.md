# Brainstorming improvements to Bevordle

Functionality:
- making sure you can't input the same word twice in one game
- making sure you can't input characters
- making sure you can't input numbers

Improvements:
- adding in a "Hard" version, like real Wordle has
- making sure every word entered is a real, acceptable word
- adding in levels of difficulty
- adding in hints
- adding a timer, and your time would be displayed in results
